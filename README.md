- #### Settings panel
A floating UI that shows system settings directly in the context of an app by taking advantage of the Slices feature. Currently the invokable settings are internet connectivity, NFC, and audio volume.

- #### Location permission
Users now have more control over when apps can get access to device location. When an app running on Android Q requests location access, users are prompted with a dialog which allows the, to grant location access to two different extents: while in use (foreground only) or all the time (foreground and background).
